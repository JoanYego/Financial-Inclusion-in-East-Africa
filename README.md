# Financial-Inclusion-in-East-Africa

This repository applies descriptive and inferential statistics to a data science project.

Some of the techniques covered include univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis(reduction techniques)

# Project Description

Financial inclusion means individuals and businesses are able to access useful financial products and services that serves their specific needs. For instance, taking a bank loan to start a business that will allow one to generate income and ultimately improve their standard of living. One of the main challenges of economic and human development in Africa is lack of financial inclusion.

Access to banks is a huge indicator of financial inclusion. Commercial banks allow individuals and business to not only save and make payments efficiently but also build up their credit worthiness (through borrowing and repaying accordingly) which can improve their access to financial instruments and services. In Kenya, uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda only 13.9% of the adult population have or use bank accounts. This implies that a majority of the population does not have access to a lot of financial services which can greatly impact their financial outcomes.

Being able to predict which individuals are most likely to have a bank accounts will allow for an efficient way to reach those whose are cut off from the financial ecosystem.

The aim of this analysis is to come up with a model that can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
